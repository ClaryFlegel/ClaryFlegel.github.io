### Maths Café Talks: 
I am the co-organiser of the [Maths Café Talks](https://mathsgym.hw.ac.uk/past-maths-cafe-talks/) at Heriot-Watt University. These are a regular series of talks given by invited lecturers on a topic of their research to an undergraduate audience. The aim of these talks is to improve student-lecturer relationships and stimulate interest in further research topics. 
We are always happy to receive speaker suggestions from Heriot-Watt students.

I am also active in the [local committe](https://piscopia.co.uk/heriot-watt-university-committee/) of the Piscopia initiative, which is a UK-wide network of women and non-binary students and researchers in Mathematics and related disciplines.
