Some other things I'm doing.

## Maths Newsletter: 
I am the co-founder and editor of the [Heriot-Watt Maths Newsletter](https://mathsgym.hw.ac.uk/maths-cafe/maths-cafe-newsletters/). Check out our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWGzrezCGIKW_cfchwxIMEQ)!

## Maths Café Talks: 
I am the co-organiser of the [Maths Café Talks](https://mathsgym.hw.ac.uk/past-maths-cafe-talks/) at Heriot-Watt University. These are a regular series of talks given by invited lecturers on a topic of their research to an undergraduate audience. The aim of these talks is to improve student-lecturer relationships and stimulate interest in further research topics. 


## Piscopia initiative: 
I am also active in the [local committe](https://piscopia.co.uk/heriot-watt-university-committee/) of the Piscopia initiative, which is a UK-wide network of women and non-binary undergraduate/MSc students, PhD students, and researchers in Mathematics and related disciplines. Check out our [Upcoming events](https://piscopia.co.uk/) and [Join our mailing list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-FZJdwpj408GP1rohoC9z6-fNNv--WCP52_vC6gWIte5-bw/viewform)!
